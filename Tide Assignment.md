### Project specs

Create a simple Web3 Project in which a user is able to Mint an NFT only if the user has done a Tx in the last day on Uniswap.

### To do list:

- A simple frontend
- Wallet connection
- The ability to track swaps on Uniswap
- The NFT minting should be enabled only after the action is done.

### What is expected

- A Github repo containing a working solution that can be easily installed and tested locally
- Plus: hosting a Live demo site

### Technical info

There are no required tools for the completion of the assignment, the evaluation will be done depending on the usage of those tools and the overall result.

If you are in doubt of which tool to use, you can try with what we are currently using on Tide:

- [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend
- [`Foundry`](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) as a smart contracts development environment
